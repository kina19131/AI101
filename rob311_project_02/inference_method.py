    """
    pl_fc_entails function executes the Propositional Logic forward chaining algorithm (AIMA pg 258).
    It verifies whether the Knowledge Base (KB) entails the query
        Inputs
        ---------
            symbols_list  - a list of symbol(s) (have to be integers) used for this inference problem
            KB_clauses    - a list of definite_clause(s) composed using the numbers present in symbols_list 
            known_symbols - a list of symbol(s) from the symbols_list that are known to be true in the KB (facts)
            query         - a single symbol that needs to be inferred

            Note: Definitely check out the test below. It will clarify a lot of your questions.

        Outputs
        ---------
        return - boolean value indicating whether KB entails the query
